# PassGen
This program can generate easy to remember passwords which look like real words but they are not. It is much easier for brain to remember them as whole words and not as separate sequence of random chars. You also can use "Calls" feature to convert any password or text into international NATO phonetic alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta...) so it will be easy to pass them correctly thru phone or radio conversation.
